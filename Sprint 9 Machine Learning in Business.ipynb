    "### Project Reflection & Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. How did you prepare the data for training?**  \n",
    "The datasets from all three regions were loaded and explored to verify structure and data types. The target variable (`product`) and features (`f0`, `f1`, `f2`) were separated. The data was then split into training and validation sets using an 75:25 ratio, ensuring reproducibility with a fixed random state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Have you followed all the steps of the instructions?**  \n",
    "Yes. The project was structured precisely as outlined:\n",
    "- Data loading and preparation\n",
    "- Training and validating a linear regression model for each region\n",
    "- Calculating the minimum required volume for profitability\n",
    "- Selecting the top 200 wells\n",
    "- Estimating profit\n",
    "- Applying bootstrapping for risk analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Have you taken into account all the business conditions?**  \n",
    "Yes. The analysis considered:\n",
    "- The budget limit of $100 million for 200 wells\n",
    "- The revenue of $4,500 per thousand barrels\n",
    "- A maximum acceptable loss risk of 2.5%\n",
    "- Limiting development to 500 sampled wells per region\n",
    "These constraints were used in the profit and risk calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What are your findings about the task study?**  \n",
    "Region 1 showed the highest average predicted reserves and the lowest RMSE during validation. Additionally, Region 1 had the highest average profit and a loss risk below the 2.5% threshold, making it the most profitable and least risky option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Have you applied the Bootstrapping technique correctly?**  \n",
    "Yes. Bootstrapping was implemented with 1,000 resamples of 500 wells each. For each sample, the top 200 wells were selected, profit calculated, and results aggregated to obtain the mean profit, 95% confidence interval, and risk of loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Have you suggested the best region for well development? Is the choice justified?**  \n",
    "Yes. Region 1 is recommended. It meets all the business constraints and achieves the best balance between profitability and risk. The decision is backed by empirical analysis from bootstrapped profit distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Did you avoid code duplication?**  \n",
    "Yes. Functions were used for modeling (`train_validate_model`) and profit calculation (`calculate_profit`), ensuring reusable and modular code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Have you kept to the project structure and kept the code neat?**  \n",
    "Yes. The project is organized into clear, labeled sections with markdown headings. Code is concise, well-commented, and follows a logical flow from data preparation to final recommendation.\n"

    "### General Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we analyzed geological data from three regions to identify the most profitable and least risky location for new oil well development on behalf of OilyGiant. Using linear regression models, we predicted the potential volume of reserves and applied strict business conditions, including budget constraints and acceptable risk thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We followed a structured approach:\n",
    "- Preprocessed and validated the data\n",
    "- Trained and evaluated models for each region\n",
    "- Calculated expected profits and minimum viable production volumes\n",
    "- Applied the bootstrapping technique to estimate variability and risk\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating all three regions, **Region 1** emerged as the most promising location. It provided:\n",
    "- The **highest expected profit**\n",
    "- A **low risk of loss (under 2.5%)**\n",
    "- A favorable balance between predicted reserves and business constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this study can guide strategic investment decisions with a data-driven approach. Our analysis ensures financial feasibility and risk mitigation, aligning with OilyGiant's goals for sustainable and profitable resource development.\n"
